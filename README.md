Lesson 7 Lab: Deploying Files with Templates
• To configure Anonymous FTP upload, you'll need to make sure that the 
following is accomplished

• vsftpd.conf is modified to allow anonymous FTP access and uploads
• The directory /var/ftp/pub is configured with the appropriate permissions
• The directory /var/ftp/pub is con
figured with the appropriate SELinux context 
label
• The SELinux boolean ftpd_anon_write is set to on
• Create a playbook that ensures that the vsftpd service is installed, enabled, 
the firewall is opened, and the above requirements are met. Define 
variables in the playbook to set vsftpd.conf parameters, and use these in a 
template
• At the end of the playbook, verify connectivity, uploading the /etc/hosts 
file from localhost
